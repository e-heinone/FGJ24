Mouse cursor checks the tag for object under cursor
If item has tag which relates to cursor, change state to the corresponding state.
If no mouse related tags, set default state.


Adding new mouse states:
Add new tag, name MouseCursorNAME
Create new state class, inherit from MouseCursorState_Base, override methods within. Implement functionality.
Add new else if into void RaycastMousePositionAndChangeState, found in MouseCursorController.cs
